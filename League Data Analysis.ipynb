    "With a player base of over 150 million unique registered users, League of Legends is by far the most popular game in the world.\n",
    "Created by Riot Games, LoL has exploded globally since its inception in 2009. While it is well known in North America in Europe, the dominance of LoL in eastern countries, such as China or South Korea, brings more attention to it every year; for example, there have been amusement parks, restaurants, and even eSports towns built in China, all dedicated to the game. \n"

    "<h2>What is League of Legends?</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Although the game accentuates an entire culture of entertainment and magic, the game itself is much more binary. In a single game of Summoner's Rift, the primary game mode and map of League of Legends, two teams of 5 players compete against each other to destroy the another team's Nexus, a crystal structure in the center of their base, first. There are several obstacles inhibiting the completion of this task: first, obviously, is the enemy team themselves, who will do everything in their power to do the same to you; second, there are protective structures on the map, known as turrets, that must be broken first before the Nexus is destructible. Additionally, there are neutral objectives on the map that are obtainable by either team, and oftentimes there will be team fights to determine who will take the objective. More so than not, the team that wins these deciding fights will ultimately win the game.</p>  \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Before players load onto the map, they must first decide what champion, or character, they will use to represent them. There are a variety of factors that go into this decision, but for the sake of statistical data analysis, they are negligible and will not ultimately affect the main factors that will predict which team will win. However, during the game, important statistics such as total gold, experience, kills and deaths, and structures destroyed are tracked, so we will be using these factors to predict if the blue side team won or lost.</p> \n",

In League of Legends, there are 8 possible tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger. To ensure quality data, all of the match data takes place between the ranks of high Diamond and low Master. The dataset keeps track of 19 unique factors for both teams, as well as the unique game id and if the blue team won or lost. \n"

The purpose of exploring this data is to figure out if there are any correlations between the game stats vs. the win percentage of the blue team. We will take a look at the win percentage of the blue team that had a gold lead during the game, the win percentage of the blue team that obtained First Blood, the win percentage of the blue team that had heralds, and some more comparisons. \n",

In League of Legends, two of the best statistics that will give you an advantageous position is having a gold lead, or an experience lead. These statistics are reflected in the blueGoldDiff and blueExperienceDiff columns, where the value reflected is the blue team's positive or negative difference in either category. Using these columns, and the column that tells if the blue team won or lost, we are able to calculate the average win rate of blue team if they have a gold lead by dividing the total number of games where blue WINS and HAS a gold lead, by solely the total WINS of blue team."

    "The next analysis is similar to the win rate based on First Bloods, however, it is using something within the game called Heralds. Heralds are a monster within the game which when secured will allow for the team to spawn a monster near a tower and do significant damage to it. If the herald was secured early enough within the game, it is possible to obtain a second one before the 20 minute mark when something called the Baron spawns. The herald is an important monster in the beginning stages of the game because towers have something called \"shields\" which have 5 sections and at each broken stage it gives 160 gold. When the herald is spawned and does damage to a tower it takes town around 2 and a half \"shields\" off the tower which is 320 gold, if it destroys the tower while in the process that adds an extra 150 gold split between the nearest players.\n",
    "\n",
    "This early advantage could be enough to alter the later stages of the game, and even the result! Below we calculate the number of wins when the blue team had obtained one or more heralds. We then also calculate the total heralds obtained by the blue team and then divide the wins by the total to get the win percentage when heralds are secured."

    "In conclusion, a match of League of Legends has numerous different factors that play a part in it. Both teams will constantly battle for an advantageous position in all of them, in hopes of using that lead to eventually win the game. Although there are also many outside, external factors that can't be tracked, such as team mentality and disconnected players, using these statistical factors provides a great dataset that can be used to predict if blue team wins or loses. \n",

    "In our own analysis, we first cleaned the data to take out red side data, as much of it is inversely related to blue side data. We also removed the unique gameID columns, as it is not needed. Finally, we removed the \"PerMin\" data columns, as they are the same as the \"Total\" columns, just divided by 10. Then we illustrated the importance of gold and experience difference, first blood rate, and herald control within the first 10 minutes of the game, all of which showed that if you had an advantageous position in any of these factors, you were more likely to win than lose. Finally, using Multiple Linear Regression, we trained a machine learning model to predict if blue side won or lost based on the given blue side statistics. After fitting the model with the data, we were able to conclude that the model was fairly accurate in predicting the correct game result. \n"
